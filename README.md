# AutoReject
Android (10+) application that automatically rejects phone calls from unwanted callers. 
Works by reading the caller's phone number, and if the number starts with any numbers form the black-list, the phone call will be automatically rejected. 
If the white-list is turned on, the application will only let through numbers that start with any of the numbers from the list.

Note: this repository has not been cleaned up yet and the UI was built poorly. It will be updated and cleaned up.
